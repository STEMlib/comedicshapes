# Summary
Inspired by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/stand-up/), where they analyze the structure of Ali Wong's comedy special "Baby Cobra". Here I analyze Kevin Hart's special to look for a shape to his structure. For example, notice that these longer specials often reference jokes from earlier but there are also new jokes thrown into the bits. How are these jokes connected?
